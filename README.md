## What is this Repository about?
This respository contains solutions to Rebecca Murphey's repo : [https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment)

## I know where the answers are
That's okay. But, I like to challenge myself all the time. Hence, this is my own version of solutions. And, I promise I haven't looked at Rebecca's answers. Give her all the reps please for these amazing assignment compilations.
